**Project Overview**
This project leverages PostgreSQL as the database management system to deliver an interactive and educational game designed to test users' knowledge of world countries and their capitals.

**Game Concept**
The primary aim of this game is to challenge players by presenting them with a country name as the question. Players must respond with the corresponding capital city.

**Gameplay Mechanics:**
If the user correctly identifies the capital, they earn a point.
Conversely, an incorrect response results in the end of the game.
**Technologies Used**
This project is built using:

**JavaScript**: For the client-side functionality.
**Node.js**: To handle the server-side logic.
**PostgreSQL**: As the robust database solution to store and manage data related to countries and their capitals
Enjoy the Game!!!!
